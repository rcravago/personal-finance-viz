<!-- ROXANNE'S PROBLEM TO SOLVE: -->
<!-- I want to spend less than I earn. I think I spend more than I earn. -->
<!-- IDEAS: -->
<!-- ratio spent : earned -->

<!-- Fixed recurring expenses aside, out of my variable expenses, I think I spend the most on eating out -->
<!-- IDEAS: -->
<!-- input fixed expenses -->
<!-- input rest of variable expenses -->
<!-- input eating out expenses for 1 wk, 1 mo -->
<!-- input grocery expenses for 1 wk, 1 mo -->

<!-- Why? -->
<!-- 1) I think I eat out too frequently, both alone and with people -->
<!-- IDEAS: -->
<!-- 3rd-party API: sunrise calendar currently integrates my swarm checkins, can I get this data for restaurants and cafés? -->
<!-- weekly tally of # times ate out -->

<!-- 2) I think that for each meal, I spend on avg >$20 -->
<!-- IDEAS: -->
<!-- take weekly eating out spending, and calculate avg -->

<!-- 3) I also really love trying new places, new foods -->
<!-- IDEAS: -->
<!-- 3rd-party API: take swarm checkins and return # unique check-ins at restaurants/cafés -->

<!-- 4) I also tend to like 'nice' restaurants, good quality food  -->
<!-- (ex. hard to go to a random hole in the wall unless I've been recommended that it's good) -->
<!-- IDEAS: -->
<!-- 3rd-party API: take swarm checkins at restaurants/cafés and return pie chart of $$ rating -->

<!-- 5) But I also really like to cook -->
<!-- 6) and sometimes grocery shop, but the grocery store is too far and most nights I don't like shopping post work -->
<!-- IDEAS: -->
<!-- ratio eating out : groceries -->
