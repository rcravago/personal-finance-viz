<!-- NISHA'S PROTOTYPE -->

<!-- PROBLEM: -->
<!-- I am not sure if I am overspending, and I think that I am -->
<!-- I feel guilty about big expenditures or when I spend too much in a short period of time  -->
<!-- I want to have more control over my budget, but find it hard to know whether or not I am overspending -->
<!-- I want to save and feel confident that I am always in budget without always thinking about every expense or tracking my money all the time -->
<!-- I know that I need to save for the future (home, kids, retirement), but it's hard figure out how to make that actually happen -->
<!-- I'm too busy with other things in my life to dedicate time to this -->

<!-- HYPOTHESES: -->
<!-- If I can track my spending easily and create a dynamic enough budget, I will gain better control and awareness -->
